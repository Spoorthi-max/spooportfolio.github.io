## Efficiently Tracking the Movement of Harvested Crops from Farm to Market

### 1. Graph Algorithms

- Model the supply chain network with nodes representing locations (e.g., farms, storage facilities, markets) and edges representing transportation routes.
- Algorithms like Dijkstra's or A* can help find the shortest or most efficient path.

- ### 2. Linked lists

-Linked Lists are used for
## Dynamic Storage

### Efficient for Scenarios with Changing Crop Tracking List
- Efficient for scenarios where the size of the crop tracking list changes frequently (e.g., new stops added dynamically).

### Efficient Insertion/Deletion
- Quick updates when locations or tracking steps are added or removed.

### Traversal Flexibility
- Allows linear traversal to generate reports or monitor progress in real time.

### Memory Efficiency
- No pre-allocation of memory; only uses memory for the actual number of nodes.

### 3. Tree Structures

- Used for hierarchical data representation, such as organizing crops by type, batch, or destination.
- Binary search trees or AVL trees can help in efficiently searching and sorting this data.

### 4. Hash Tables

- Useful for quick lookups and data retrieval, such as tracking the status of shipments or inventory levels at different locations.

### 5. Sorting Algorithms

- To organize data efficiently, such as sorting crops by delivery deadlines or priority.

### 6. Queue Data Structures

- For managing tasks in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner, such as scheduling pickups and deliveries.

### 7. Priority Queues

- Similar to queues but with prioritization, useful for managing urgent deliveries or high-priority crops.
