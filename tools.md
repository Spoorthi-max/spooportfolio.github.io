## Efficiently Tracking the Movement of Harvested Crops from Farm to Market

### 1. Graph Algorithms
- Model the supply chain network with nodes representing locations (e.g., farms, storage facilities, markets) and edges representing transportation routes.
- Algorithms like Dijkstra's or A* can help find the shortest or most efficient path.

### 2. Tree Structures
- Used for hierarchical data representation, such as organizing crops by type, batch, or destination.
- Binary search trees or AVL trees can help in efficiently searching and sorting this data.

### 3. Hash Tables
- Useful for quick lookups and data retrieval, such as tracking the status of shipments or inventory levels at different locations.

### 4. Sorting Algorithms
- To organize data efficiently, such as sorting crops by delivery deadlines or priority.

### 5. Queue Data Structures
- For managing tasks in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner, such as scheduling pickups and deliveries.

### 6. Priority Queues
- Similar to queues but with prioritization, useful for managing urgent deliveries or high-priority crops.
### 8. Linked lists
